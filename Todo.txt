Macro:

- fetch urls
- capture data
- make calculations
- compose maps
- output json
- polish
- deploy


Micro:
- init really just instantiates those variables? What ins, outs and states change?
- move init to the constructor
- Should "inputs" be final?
- implement maps and reduce
- headers must be a k:v pair
